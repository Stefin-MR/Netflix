In this assignment, you will analyze the following five semiconductor stocks: `HD`, `INTC`, `AMD`, `MU`, `NVDA`, and `TSM`. Then, you will choose the stock with the least correlation to `JNJ` in order to diversify a portfolio. The data was generated using the [GOOGLEFINANCE](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281?hl=en) historical market data script.
