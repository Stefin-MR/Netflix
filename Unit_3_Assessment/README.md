# Unit 3 Assessment

This assessment will evaluate your knowledge of Matplotlib, Plotly, and NumPy. The [Unit_3_Assessment_unsolved.ipynb](Unsolved/Unit_3_Assessment_unsolved.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook file contains all the questions for this assessment.

## Instructions

* Depending on the question, you might need to write code or type your selection from a set of multiple choice options. Carefully read each question to ensure that your answer matches the intended format.

* Some of the questions in this assessment require you to import datasets from files that the [Resources](Unsolved/Resources) folder contains.

  **Important:** You do not need to submit the datasets with your submission notebook.

* The assessment exists in a Jupyter notebook. This means that you can freely run code and edit code blocks. You can also create additional code blocks to help you answer the assessment questions&mdash;as long as the location of your answer to each assessment question is unmistakably clear.

  **Important:** If your notebook is too difficult to read, or you don’t clearly identify your answer, you might receive a zero for that question.

  **Tip:** We recommend that you make a copy of the assessment notebook to use as you work through each question. When you complete a question, transfer your answer to your submission notebook.
