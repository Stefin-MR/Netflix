# Unit 4 Assessment

The Unit 4 assessment covers Python and Pandas, as well as some GitHub. All of the questions for this assessment are contained in the [Unit_4_Assessment_unsolved.ipynb](Unsolved/Unit_4_Assessment_unsolved.ipynb) Jupyter notebook file.

## Instructions

* There are different types of question formats. For example, some questions require you to write code, and other questions ask you to choose from a set of options and type your answer in the provided cell. Read each question carefully to ensure that your answer matches the intended format.

* Some of the questions in this assessment require you to import datasets from files located in the [Resources](../../03-Assessments/Unit_4_Assessment/Unsolved/Resources) folder.  You do NOT need to submit the datasets as part of the assessment; only submit the notebook containing your answers. 

* The assessment exists in a Jupyter notebook. This means that you can freely run code and edit code blocks. You can also create additional code blocks to help you answer the assessment questions&mdash;as long as the location of your answer to each assessment question is unmistakably clear.

    * If your answers are not clearly identified, you may receive a score of “0” for that question. 

    * We recommend that you make a copy of the assessment notebook to use as you work through each question. Once you complete a question, transfer your answer to your submission notebook.
